Research experience
======
* Design of Knowledge Graph-Based Legal Regulations Knowledge Query and Popularization System
  * Guizhou University Guiyang, Guizhou, China.
  * Supervisor: Professor Ruizhang Huang (06/2021-03/2022)
  * Duties included:
    * Led the team to create a legal provision search system offering related case references for professionals and non-professionals
    * Constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph linking legal statutes with relevant case law
    * Designed and trained single-label and multi-label classification models using BERT to process case descriptions and judgment documents
